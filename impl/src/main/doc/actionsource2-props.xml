          MethodExpression representing the application action to invoke
          when this component is activated by the user.  The expression
          must evaluate to a public method that takes no parameters, and
          returns an Object (the toString() of which is called to derive
          the logical outcome) which is passed to the NavigationHandler
          for this application.
