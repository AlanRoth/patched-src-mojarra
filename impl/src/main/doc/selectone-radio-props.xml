          Specifies the name of the radio button group. Radio button components
          having the same group within a <code>UIForm</code> parent will uncheck
          all others when being checked. If the <code>value</code> attribute is
          absent then the one from first component of the group will be used. If
          the <code>UISelectItem</code> child is absent then the one from first
          component of the group will be used. When specified, the
          <code>group</code> attribute disables the default rendering of the
          "table" element and any attribute related to the rendering of the
          "table" element, such as "border", is ignored.
