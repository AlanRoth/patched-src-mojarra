            ExceptionHandler#handle is not called when the registered PhaseListener 
            throws an exception.

            According to the JSF spec 2.1 section 13.3 "Phase Listener" 
            this is required, but UIViewRoot#notifyPhaseListeners simply
            logs the exception and does nothing.
