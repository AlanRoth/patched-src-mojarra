        <h1>Bean Validation Test</h1>
        <p>
            <em>This test sees whether disabling Bean Validation on JSF components gets 'lost' after POST-back.</em> 
        </p>
        <p>
            The field below is annotated <tt>@NotEmpty</tt>, but has <tt>&lt;f:validateBean disabled="true"/&gt;</tt> on
            the JSF component. To reproduce the problem:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leave the field blank, and click Submit</li>
            <li>Message will say 'SUCCESS' because the empty value got through (this is correct, as bean validation has been disabled)</li>
            <li>Click Submit again</li>
            <li>Message will not say 'SUCCESS' because bean validation is enabled again</li>
        </ul>
        <hr/>

            <h:messages />
