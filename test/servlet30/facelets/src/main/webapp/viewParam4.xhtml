        <title>starting page for testing JSF includeViewParams issue</title>
    </h:head>
    <h:body>
        start the test app by clicking the link below, this will pass in parameters (input1=1 and input2=2)
        to be picked up via &lt;f:viewParam .. &gt; in viewParam5.xhtml
        <br />
        <br />

        once you are on   viewParam5.xhtml   there are two ways to navigate to   viewParam6.xhtml. 
        both use a &lt; h:button&gt;  but the first uses   includeViewParams="true" 
        and the second uses &lt;f:param .. &gt; to pass the parameters. Only the second works
        correctly
