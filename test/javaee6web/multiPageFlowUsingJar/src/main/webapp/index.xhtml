<pre>

With FacesFlows, it is possible to bundle an entrire flow into a jar
file.  Then, the mere presence of one or more such jar files in the
application's classpath (usually by virtue of placing the jar in
WEB-INF/lib) is sufficient to make those flows accessible to the
application.

Here is the required arrangement of a flow packaged within a jar.

META-INF/beans.xml
META-INF/flows/{flowName}/{flowName}-flow.xml
META-INF/flows/{flowName}/{viewNode}.xhtml
{javaPackagePath}/{javaClassName}.class

Here is an example of the contents of a jar file conforming to the
preceding packaging requirements.

META-INF/beans.xml
META-INF/flows/bounded-task-flow/bounded-task-flow-flow.xml
META-INF/flows/bounded-task-flow/bounded-task-flow.xhtml
META-INF/flows/bounded-task-flow/next_a.xhtml
META-INF/flows/bounded-task-flow/next_b.xhtml
com/sun/faces/test/webprofile/flow/basic/FlowBean.class

    <h:form prependId="false">
        <p><h:commandButton id="start" value="start flow on valid entry node" action="bounded-task-flow" /></p>
        <p><h:commandButton id="stay" value="stay" /></p>
    </h:form>
